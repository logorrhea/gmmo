# Golang MMO Server Project

Trying to follow the MMO tutorials from the video series
[here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL_4rJ_acBNMEGUMuO7IbivLgnvUxHklnj).
This tutorial series is actually using NodeJS, but I thought it would be
interesting to try to follow the tutorial but use Go instead.
